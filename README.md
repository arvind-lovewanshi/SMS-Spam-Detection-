# SMS-Spam-Detection-
Developed a Python-based SMS spam detector to classify messages as spam or non-spam, utilizing Naive Bayes algorithms (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli) for effective spam classification. Additional algorithms like Decision Tree and Logistic Regression were implemented to evaluate performance. The dataset was preprocessed for feature extraction, handling missing values, and text normalization using Pandas and NumPy. Models were trained on labeled datasets and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving high classification accuracy and providing a reliable tool for SMS spam detection.
